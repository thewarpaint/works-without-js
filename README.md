# Works without JS

Empower your users with disabled Javascript to experience your website

## Background

Javascript is an awesome technology has helped us pushed the web forward to a place we could hardly imagine twenty years ago.

However, we have relied on it too much for a while now, and assumed it must be used by default, without thinking if it
is a good fit for our use case.

- Static-content sites like online newspapers and magazines, technical documentation, etc.

This doesn't mean that your site should be free of Javascript. Instead, you should still be able to provide your core 
experience
via graceful degradation or progressive enhancement whenever possible.
